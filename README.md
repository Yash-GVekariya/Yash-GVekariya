## Hi there 👋

I am Yash, a tech enthusiast from India.

I have some hobbies like Video-Editing(Yt channel), Music Production and playing games sometimes.
I am honing my programming skills with python (numpy, pandas) in the way of learning Machine Learning, am familiar with the basic Web technologies.
I am also learing the tools like VS-Code, Jupyter, Git - Github, AI (when i get stuck😋).

I am periodically active on my social media pages (links in bio), also created a website with my WebDev skills( and a little help of AI 😋).
